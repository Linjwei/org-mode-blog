* Helm commands

=helm-mini= is a Helm command to switch buffers or open recent files. For me this is the most useful Helm command and I use it all the time instead of other buffer switchers like =iswitchb= or =ido-switch-buffer=. The source code:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defun helm-mini ()
  "Preconfigured `helm' lightweight version \(buffer -> recentf\)."
  (interactive)
  (require 'helm-files)
  (let ((helm-ff-transformer-show-only-basename nil))
    (helm-other-buffer '(helm-source-buffers-list
                         helm-source-recentf
                         helm-source-buffer-not-found)
                       "*helm mini*")))
#+END_SRC

We can see that it calls =helm-other-buffer= with 3 sources, first a list of open buffers, then the recent files and a source to create new files. It is possible to create custom commands with just the sources you might like.

* Helm sources

Sources like =helm-source-recentf= configure what the source will contain:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(defvar helm-source-recentf
  `((name . "Recentf")
    (init . (lambda ()
              (require 'recentf)
              (recentf-mode 1)))
    (candidates . recentf-list)
    (match . helm-files-match-only-basename)
    (filtered-candidate-transformer . (lambda (candidates _source)
                                        (cl-loop for i in candidates
                                                 if helm-ff-transformer-show-only-basename
                                                 collect (cons (helm-basename i) i)
                                                 else collect i)))
    (no-delay-on-input)
    (keymap . ,helm-generic-files-map)
    (help-message . helm-generic-file-help-message)
    (mode-line . helm-generic-file-mode-line-string)
    (action . ,(cdr (helm-get-actions-from-type
                     helm-source-locate))))
  "See (info \"(emacs)File Conveniences\").
Set `recentf-max-saved-items' to a bigger value if default is too small.")
#+END_SRC
